## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it privately using GitHub's **private vulnerability reporting** feature. This ensures the issue can be resolved responsibly before any details are made public.

### How to Report
1. Go to the [Security Tab](../../security/advisories) of this repository.
2. Click **Report a Vulnerability**.
3. Provide a detailed description of the issue, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the issue.
   - Any suggestions for mitigation or fixes (optional).

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- **Resolution Plan**: A detailed plan will be shared with you within 7 days.
- **Patch Release**: A patch will be released as soon as possible, and you will be notified once it is available.

### Public Disclosure Policy
To ensure the safety of all users, we kindly request that you:
- **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we have released a patch.
- If you do not receive a response from us within 48 hours of submitting your report, you may choose to disclose the vulnerability responsibly at your discretion.

## Security Updates

Once a vulnerability is resolved, details will be published in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file, and a GitHub Security Advisory will be created if necessary to notify users.
